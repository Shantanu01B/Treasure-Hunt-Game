# Treasure-Hunt-Game
Simple treasure hunt Game developed using Python

The game starts by playing an audio file and welcoming the player with their name.

The player is on a quest to find ancestral treasure with a map.

The player is presented with two initial locations to choose from: a forest and a desert.

Depending on the chosen location, the player encounters different scenarios and makes choices, ultimately leading to either a successful treasure hunt or a game over.

In the forest, the player can navigate through paths, encounter various obstacles, and potentially find the treasure.

In the desert, the player can choose to approach a camel or a pond, leading to different outcomes.

After each playthrough, the player is given the option to play again or exit the game.

The game utilizes audio, colorful text, and conditional statements to create a user-friendly interactive experience.

The game is organized into a while loop, allowing the player to play multiple times. The code also imports additional modules for handling the treasure key and treasure hunt functionality.
